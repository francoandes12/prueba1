          <p>
            The best DJs know that Djing is first about being able to read
            people and then about being able to tap into that human experience
            and take it on a journey. Sasha has always been noted for being a
            master at this, If there are boundaries yet to be broken, then you
            can bet that Sasha has got them in the crosshairs. He's been
            battering them down since Shelley's, The Hacienda, Renaissance and
            Twilo; from Airdrawndagger to Invol3r. Since 2011, he's carved a new
            way with his increasingly pivotal Last Night On Earth imprint, the
            label that has introduced into its family fiercely forward-thinking
            producers like My Favourite Robot's James Teej, Simon Baker,
            ThermalBear, Ejeca, Ghosting Season, Max Cooper and Knox. Then there
            was the arrival of the long-awaited third album in his 'Involver'
            series in 2013, the intricate and challenging 'Involv3r'. It
            combined on one disc Sasha's peerless command of dance floor
            sensibilities and on the other his skilful exploration of beatless
            soundscapes, featuring his exclusive interpretations of tracks from
            The xx, Blondes, Little Dragon, Benjamin Damage, Foals and
            ThermalBear. It also featured 'Shoot You Down', his own
            spine-chilling anthem with vocals from the beguiling Swedish
            chanteuse Kicki Halmos. Boundaries out of the studio have been
            equally unsafe. Taking over with his Last Night on Earth parties
            around the globe, Sasha has brought nothing but the finest line-ups
            to clubbers around the world. Last summer he hit the world-renowned
            Space Ibiza with a monthly LNOE residency, which showcased the likes
            of Scuba, Catz & Dogz, Heidi, Magda and of course Sasha himself. He
            also hosted his first festival arena with Last Night on Earth at SW4
            in the capital earlier this year. It doesn’t stop here though. 2015
            will see Sasha taking things to another level on and off the dance
            floor. Expect big things from his parties around the world, which he
            is running alongside his imprint label Last Night on Earth. In his
            own words, Sasha says, “We have some really exciting things planned
            for 2015, some great releases and I will be collaborating with some
            of the very talented artists we have championed" <br />
